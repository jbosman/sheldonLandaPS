					<h2>Monday - Thursday 11AM - 8PM</h2>
				
					<p>Each student is unique. We start with a discussion about your piano goals, then create a customized lesson plan to meet your needs.</p>
					
					<p>I especially enjoy working with adults who played a little in the past but discontinued for one reason or the other, and want to have the piano back in their life. I admire and encourage that attitude!</p>
			
					<p>Love to teach students how to write their own songs and to improvise. I created a step by step approach designed for that.</p>

					<p>For complete beginners, I have all the materials we need to get started. All you need to bring is a receptive state of mind and a small notebook!</p>
				
					<p>I've recently purchased a Steinway baby grand piano! So, even though my apt is kind of small, our classes will be on a big, beautiful, sensitive, extremely responsive, wonderful sounding Steinway!</p>
