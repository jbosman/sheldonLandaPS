						Each student is unique. We start with a discussion about your piano goals, then create a customized lesson plan to meet your needs. I've recently purchased a Steinway baby grand piano, so even though my apt is kind of small, our classes will be on a big, beautiful, sensitive, extremely responsive, wonderful sounding acoustic baby grand piano!

					<h2>Beginners</h2>
					<p>
						For complete beginners, I have all the materials we need to get started including an adult beginner book (that I re sell for $20). All you need to bring is a receptive state of mind and a small notebook.

					<h2>Intermediate - Advanced</h2>

						I especially enjoy working with adults who played a little in the past but discontinued for one reason or the other, and want to have the piano back in their life. I admire and encourage that attitude!

						Love to teach students how to write their own songs and to improvise. I created a step by step approach designed for that.
